      <p1><strong>For Immediate Release</strong><br>November 10, 2023<br><br></p1>
      <h2>County Executive-Elect Taxes Announces Key Administration Figures</h2>
      <p1><br>Delfino, FL — Today, County Executive-Elect TaxesArentAwesome announced their plan regarding key members of the Broadview County government. This administration has made it a top priority to have a functioning and active government that can properly execute their duties that have been entrusted in their respective offices. Each new person listed, whether newly-appointed or retained from the previous administration, has the personal confidence of the County Executive-elect to be adept in their roles in the new administration.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>The administration is listed as follows:</p1>
      <div style="max-width: 95%; padding-top: 10px">
        <p1><strong>Leesburg Police Department</strong><br>Dino_Raf will remain Chief of Police for the Leesburg Police Department.</p1>
        <p1><br><br><strong>Broadview County Fire & Rescue</strong><br>USArmy03 will remain Fire Chief for Station 19 of the Broadview County Fire & Rescue service.</p1>
        <p1><br><br><strong>Broadview County Transit Department</strong><br>wclouts will remain Director for the Broadview County Transit Department.</p1>
        <p1><br><br><strong>Broadview County State Attorney's Office</strong><br>In light of the vacancy created by my resignation and subsequent election to County Executive, the State Attorney role is left empty in need of a new leader that can maintain the strong values that I left behind. In light of such, I intend to nominate BobFogerty to be the Fourth State Attorney for Broadview County. Fogerty is a U.S. Supreme Court Justice for nUSA and has served various other roles in an impressive capacity. His work demonstrates professionalism and proficiency in the field of law. My administration will stand firm behind him.</p1>
        <p1><br><br><strong>Broadview County Clerk</strong><br>I intend to nominate AlbertWellesley to be Clerk for Broadview County. Wellesley is the current Clerk for the Appeals Division of the Broadview County Court and has maintained an active role in assisting the lower court in their duties. Throughout my time as State Attorney, I personally interacted with Wellesley when bringing cases to the courtroom and when working with the courts on major projects that required extensive resources from both my office and the courts. I am confident in his ability to overhaul the filing system that has failed this county.</p1>
        <p1><br><br><strong>Broadview County Circuit Public Defender</strong><br>Acerxtro will remain Chief Public Defender for the Broadview County Circuit Courts.</p1>
