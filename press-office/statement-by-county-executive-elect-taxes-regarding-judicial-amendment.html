      <h2>Statement By County Executive-Elect Taxes Regarding Judicial Amendment Rejection</h2>
      <p1><br>Delfino, FL — Frustrated with the inactivity and incompetence that has infested the judiciary of this group, an amendment to the Broadview County Charter was proposed to begin retention elections to allow voters to hold their third branch of government accountable. This amendment passed the County Commission with flying colors, who also recognized the same need to begin holding our judiciary accountable. The question was then put to the voters in this past election. Seventy-five percent of voters moved to approve the amendment, a resounding success for transparency.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>The last step to have the amendment put into full effect was to have it approved by the judiciary, whose review was limited to determine whether the amendment violated human rights or was anti-thetical to liberty. This process was created so as to prevent majority rule encroaching on the rights of the minority groups. Their vote is not to be motivated by personal feelings or policy-making, but purely by the guidance of law. Any person, whether learned in the law or not, can tell that having judges held accountable at a retention election has nothing to do with basic human rights. The amendment is not offensive to the law by any means, because retention elections are employed in plenty of other jurisdictions in the United States.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Still, the judicial conference failed their mandate and rejected the amendment, claiming that it may expose the judiciary to outside influences. Their decision has set back the fight for government accountability and constitutes an abuse of power by judges who refuse to relinquish their commissions even if they are inactive or have no care for this group.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>I applaude the minority who realized their mandate and stayed true to the limited nature of their review. History will look favorable upon their service to their duty, and to the voters of Broadview.</p1>
