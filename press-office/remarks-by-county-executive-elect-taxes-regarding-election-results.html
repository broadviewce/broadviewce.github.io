      <h2>Remarks By County Executive-Elect Taxes Regarding Election Results</h2>
      <p1><br>Delfino, FL — Last Tuesday, voters unleashed a fiery rebuke of the past government's inactivity. If I could thank each and every one of these voters individually, I would. They've entrusted their government in my hands and I want to make it clear that they have made the right choice.I will maintain my campaign promises of providing solutions and overseeing the administration of the government in a more intimate setting so that we can get some actual work done.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>If you ask anyone that I spoke to during the campaign run, they'll tell you that I didn't want this job. I was comfortable with my previous job in the State Attorney's Office and overseeing government from afar as a community mananger. But in that second role, people would always approach me with issues regarding the government. They'd come to me looking for a group manager solution, whether it be overruling the government or replacing it. That is not my nature of doing things. I abhor groups where developers meddle constantly in their player's government. I believe in letting the system work itself out. I believe in self-rule and letting the sovereignty of the player-base be supreme except where there exists a true need to intervene.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>But then I asked, how can this government work itself out if nobody is willing to put that effort in? How can I address all these issues and grievances if I can't touch the government myself? And the choice became simple - I have to run for office to bring about the changes that I wanted to see. I wasn't hopeful, my opponent put up a great fight and managed to secure a tight margin against me.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>I want to emphasize that I am everyone's County Executive. I'm not here to push favorites, to put my friends in power, or to reap some kind of benefit through my actions. I'm just here to make this county more competitive in the marketplace of Ro-States. I want Broadview to cement itself as the next innovative game in this genre that has faced a plateau of creativity. So when I say that I'm everyone's County Executive, I mean it. And I hope that you support me through this journey of making Broadview the next Mayflower.</p1>
