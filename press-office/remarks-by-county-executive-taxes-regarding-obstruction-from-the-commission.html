      <h2>Remarks By County Executive Taxes Regarding The County Commission's Obstruction & Inactivity</h2>
      <p1><br>Leesburg, FL — <i>Today, the County Executive made the following remarks on X regarding the County Commission's inactivity. The full remarks can be found <a href="https://x.com/BroadviewExec/status/1727484028737970317?s=20">here</a>.</i></p1>
      <p1><br><br>One of the most consistent barriers to this County Government is the inactivity and lack of care by many members of the County Commission. This is the fault of leadership who lacks interest.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>I wrote a new rules package for the County Commission to consider that added new checks to their activity. It added small taskforce boards that required commissioners to organize with citizens directly. It created the position of a Floor Leader, which would whip activity and votes. Commission leadership received the package on Nov. 11th. At the Nov 15th session, leadership refused to put the package to a vote and said that they didn't have enough time to review it.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Almost a week of time for review - wasted.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Yesterday, I messaged commissioners that they needed to begin planning a meeting to consider very important topics that they put off from the Nov. 15th session.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Commission leadership instead complained about my access to their communication channels.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Instead of scheduling a session, leadership pushed out a date and time without consulting any members on whether they could attend. That session was scheduled for today at 5 PM (less than twenty-four hours after I asked for a session).</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Nobody showed up. Another week wasted.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>It is clear that current leadership has valued cheap work over its duties, which is holding back so many new opportunities for this county. I nominated a State Attorney to assist law enforcement who have been embattled in the courts with lawsuits for protecting our residents.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>Next time they say they care about their constituents, their residents, or law enforcement - remind them of this moment. Accountability is needed. Leadership must be held to answer for their obstruction to progress.</p1>
