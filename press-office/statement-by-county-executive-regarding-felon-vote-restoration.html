      <h2>Statement By The County Executive Regarding Felon Vote Restoration</h2>
      <p1><br>Delfino, FL — Today, group leadership made the correct decision in allowing convicted and arrested felons to vote in all elections within Broadview County by a restoration of their civil rights. I have always rallied behind the ability of any person, whether they be a criminal or a legal civilian, to opine on the state of the government by which they are required to abide by. No person, especially those that have been repeatedly targeted by bad-faith actors in law enforcement, should be expected to abide by the orders of a government that does not let it opine on its operation. This has been a key issue for the American system since its inception in the 18th century. Today's decision strengthens democractic values and marks a key pivotal moment towards a more inclusive future where the current division within our county will be casted aside. I'm proud to have supported this movement and to finally see change that will allow Broadview to continue its goal of innovation on Roblox.</p1>
