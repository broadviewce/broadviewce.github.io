      <p1 style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br>November 20, 2023<br></p1>
      <p1><br>   I, TaxesArentAwesome, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Charter of Broadview County and other applicable laws in my official capacity as County Executive of Broadview County, Florida, in order to stabalize the executive departments to ensure competition within department application periods and avoid bloated command staff numbers, do hereby order as follows:</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (a) PERSONNEL BUDGET— The maximum number of personnel, hereinafter referred to as the "personnel budget," for the Broadview County Sheriff's Office, Broadview County Fire & Rescue, Broadview County Transit, and Leesburg Police Department shall be as follows:</p1>
      <p1><br><br>      (i) SHERIFF'S OFFICE— The maximum number of personnel that may be employed by the Broadview County Sheriff's Office at any given time is 55 total personnel.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>      (ii) FIRE & RESCUE— The maximum number of personnel that may be employed by the Broadview County Fire & Rescue at any given time is 60 total personnel.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>      (iii) COUNTY TRANSIT— The maximum number of personnel that may be employed by the Broadview County Transit department at any given time is 65 total personnel.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>      (iv) LEESBURG POLICE— The maximum number of personnel that may be employed by the Leesburg Police Department at any given time is 50 total personnel.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (b) PERSONNEL— For the purposes of the personnel budget, a member of personnel shall be defined as, in the case of law enforcement agencies, all sworn law enforcement officers and excluding civilian non-sworn personnel. For all other departments, a member of personnel shall be defined as a person critical to the effective functioning of the department.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (c) EXCEEDED BUDGET— Any request for personnel exceeding the established personnel budget must be submitted in writing to the Broadview County Executive, justifying the need for additional personnel, and shall be subject to review and approval.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (d) LEADERSHIP RATIO— Each department is directed to maintain a personnel-to-supervisor ratio of 1 to 3. The personnel-to-supervisor ratio is defined as the total number of department personnel divided by the number of supervisory positions within the department. The departments shall take necessary measures, including hiring additional supervisors or redistributing personnel, to achieve and maintain the specified ratio.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (f) SUPERVISOR— For the purposes of the personnel-to-supervisor ratio, a supervisor shall be defined as, in the Broadview County Sheriff's Office, Broadview County Fire & Rescue, and Leesburg Police Department, a person holding the rank paygrade of Sergeant or above. For the Broadview County Transit Department, a supervisor shall be defined as a person holding the rank paygrade of Supervisor or above.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (g) ENFORCEMENT— The County Executive shall assign and delegate responsibility of monitoring compliance with this Executive Order to any office, department, or other body as necessary for the faithful execution of these regulations.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (h) EFFECTIVE DATE— This Executive Order shall take effect on December 1st, 2023.</p1>
      <p1><br><br>   (i) SEVERABILITY— This Executive Order shall be severable in that any section, subsection, or clause that is unconstitutional shall be struck while maintaining the remaining integrity of the Ordinance.</p1>
