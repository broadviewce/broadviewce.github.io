      <p1 style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br>November 30, 2023<br></p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Executive Veto Message to the County Commission Regarding Co. Ord. 6-05</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   I am returning, without my approval, County Ordinance 6-05, the "County Departmental Budgets Ordinance" (the "Ordinance"). The Broadview County Charter explicitly provides that "the County Executive shall lead the administrative services of the county [... and] shall be tasked with the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the administrative departments and shall further exercise the powers associated with those duties and tasks." Broadview County, FL Charter §302. Decisions regarding hiring, firing, and employment caps are explicitly duties related to the maintenance and daily operations of the executive departments, which places it exclusively in the jurisdiction of the County Executive - not the County Commission. This separation of powers mirrors the same separation exercised by the U.S. Constitution regarding the Congress and the President, where Congress can only pass laws that are "necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof." U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 8. Similarly, the County Commission may only "have the power to make law for the purposes of [...] providing and maintaining for the executive departments, as well as facilitating the powers of this Charter" and that "no legislation shall be passed if it utilizes or is construed in a manner to exercise the powers delegated to the Executive or the Judiciary." Broadview County Charter §207. This Ordinance exercises authority that is delegated to the Executive and does not provide nor maintain for the executive departments - instead, it subjugates it under the incorrect branch of government. Therefore, it is my duty to return County Ordinance 6-05 to the County Commission without my approval.</p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Executive Veto Message to the County Commission Regarding Co. Ord. 6-06</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   I am returning, without my approval, County Ordinance 6-06, the "Government Employee Donations Ordinance" (the "Ordinance"). For the same reason that I vetoed County Ordinance 6-06, I must reject this one. Decisions on department policy are explicitly relegated to the executive branch, not to the legislature. The Broadview County Charter explicitly provides that "the County Executive shall lead the administrative services of the county [... and] shall be tasked with the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the administrative departments and shall further exercise the powers associated with those duties and tasks." Broadview County, FL Charter §302. This Ordinance exercises authority that is delegated to the Executive and does not provide nor maintain for the executive departments - instead, it subjugates it under the incorrect branch of government. Therefore, it is my duty to return County Ordinance 6-06 to the County Commission without my approval.</p1>
