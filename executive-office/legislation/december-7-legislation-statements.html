      <p1 style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br>December 7, 2023<br></p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Signing Statement Regarding Co. Ord. 6-07</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   Today, I signed into law County Ordinance 6-07, the "Lawn Leisure Ordinance" (the "Ordinance"). Section III(a) of the Ordinance criminalizes conduct destructive to the county's parks and grasslands that cause injury to Broadview's tourism industry. I have directed all law enforcement agencies to ensure the faithful execution of the prohibitions on city grasslands, and not to focus on outer-city limit reports.</p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Executive Veto Message to the County Commission Regarding Co. Ord. 6-08</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   I am returning, without my approval, County Ordinance 6-08, the "County Departmental Budget Ordinance" (the "Ordinance"). For the same reason that I vetoed County Ordinance 6-06, I must reject this one. Decisions on department policy are explicitly relegated to the executive branch, not to the legislature. The Broadview County Charter explicitly provides that "the County Executive shall lead the administrative services of the county [... and] shall be tasked with the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the administrative departments and shall further exercise the powers associated with those duties and tasks." Broadview County, FL Charter §302. This Ordinance exercises authority that is delegated to the Executive and does not provide nor maintain for the executive departments - instead, it subjugates it under the incorrect branch of government. Therefore, it is my duty to return County Ordinance 6-06 to the County Commission without my approval.</p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Signing Statement Regarding Co. Ord. 6-09</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   Today, I signed into law County Ordinance 6-09, the "Waterways Clearance Ordinance" (the "Ordinance"). Section III of the Ordinance criminalizes the intentional obstruction of a waterway to impede the flow of maritime traffic. This Ordinance is necessary to ensure the proper administration and enforcement on the waterways of the State of Florida that reside within the County of Broadview.</p1>
