      <p1 style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br>November 27, 2023<br></p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Signing Statement Regarding Co. Ord. 6-01</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   Today, I signed into law County Ordinance 6-01, the "County Fire Department Volunteer Program Ordinance" (the "Act"). Section 4 of the Act creates budgetary funding and allocations for a reserve company under the Operations Battalion of the Broadview County Fire & Rescue Department. This allows for the department to increase employment hiring without exceeding current employment limitations. For example, a person can apply to become a reservist firefighter with the Broadview County Fire & Rescue despite their other employment in other county agencies. In light of an increase of motor vehicle accidents, more manpower is necessary to allow fire operations to resume.</p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Signing Statement Regarding Co. Ord. 6-02</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   Today, I signed into law County Ordinance 6-02, the "Broadview Traffic Court Ordinance" (the "Act"). Section 2 of the Act establishes the Traffic Court of Broadview County, Florida to hear all misdemeanor offenses regarding vehicles or motor vehicle accidents with quick ease. I intend to use this court as on-the-job training for future jurist who intend to move forward to the County Court at-large.</p1>

      <p1><br><br><b>Executive Veto Message to the County Commission Regarding Co. Ord. 6-04</b></p1>
      <p1><br><br>   I am returning, without my approval, County Ordinance 6-04, the "Repeal of the Beggars Ordinance" (the "Act"). The deterrent effect of this ordinance has assisted law enforcement significantly during their patrols. Repealing this ordinance will make difficult the duties of police and will worsen the tourism experience of the Florida Keys. It is my duty to return County Ordinance 6-04 to the County Commission without my approval.</p1>
